# Pagination Project README

This project focuses on implementing various pagination techniques for a database of popular baby names using Python. It includes three main tasks aimed at understanding and implementing pagination in a deletion-resilient manner.

## Project Overview

The Pagination Project consists of three tasks aimed at understanding different pagination methods:

1. **Simple Pagination**: Implement simple pagination by providing page and page size parameters to retrieve a specific range of data from a dataset.
2. **Hypermedia Pagination**: Implement hypermedia pagination by returning metadata along with the dataset, including details about the current page, next page, previous page, and total number of pages.
3. **Deletion-Resilient Hypermedia Pagination**: Extend hypermedia pagination to handle deletion-resilient pagination, ensuring that users do not miss items from the dataset when rows are removed between queries.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files and directories:

- **0-simple_helper_function.py**: Contains the implementation of a helper function for calculating index ranges.
- **1-simple_pagination.py**: Implements simple pagination using the index_range function.
- **2-hypermedia_pagination.py**: Implements hypermedia pagination with additional metadata.
- **3-hypermedia_del_pagination.py**: Extends hypermedia pagination to handle deletion-resilient pagination.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/alx-backend.git
```

2. Navigate to the `0x00-pagination` directory:

```bash
cd alx-backend/0x00-pagination
```

3. Ensure you have Python 3 installed:

```bash
python3 --version
```

4. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each Python file contains a class named `Server` that implements the pagination methods. To use the pagination functionality, import the `Server` class and create an instance of it. You can then call the methods to perform pagination operations.

Here's an example of how to use the pagination methods:

```python
from 1-simple_pagination import Server

server = Server()

# Get a specific page of data
page_data = server.get_page(page=1, page_size=10)
print(page_data)

# Get hypermedia metadata along with the data
hyper_data = server.get_hyper(page=1, page_size=10)
print(hyper_data)

# Handle deletion-resilient pagination
del_pagination_data = server.get_hyper_index(index=10, page_size=10)
print(del_pagination_data)
```

## Testing

The project includes test cases to ensure the correctness of the pagination methods. To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
python3 -m doctest -v *.py
```

## Conclusion

The Pagination Project provides a hands-on experience in implementing pagination techniques using Python. By completing the tasks, you will gain a deeper understanding of pagination concepts and their practical implementation.
