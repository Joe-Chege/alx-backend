## Pagination Project

### Project Overview
The Pagination Project focuses on implementing various pagination techniques for a database of popular baby names using Python. The project includes three main tasks aimed at understanding and implementing pagination in a deletion-resilient manner.

### Project Structure
The project is organized into the following files and directories:

- `0-simple_helper_function.py`: Contains the implementation of a helper function for calculating index ranges.
- `1-simple_pagination.py`: Implements simple pagination using the index_range function.
- `2-hypermedia_pagination.py`: Implements hypermedia pagination with additional metadata.
- `3-hypermedia_del_pagination.py`: Extends hypermedia pagination to handle deletion-resilient pagination.

### Setup Instructions
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/alx-backend.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the 0x00-pagination directory:
   ```
   cd alx-backend/0x00-pagination
   ```
3. Ensure you have Python 3 installed:
   ```
   python3 --version
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
Each Python file contains a class named `Server` that implements the pagination methods. To use the pagination functionality, import the `Server` class and create an instance of it. You can then call the methods to perform pagination operations.

Here's an example of how to use the pagination methods:

```python
from 1-simple_pagination import Server

server = Server()

# Get a specific page of data
page_data = server.get_page(page=1, page_size=10)
print(page_data)

# Get hypermedia metadata along with the data
hyper_data = server.get_hyper(page=1, page_size=10)
print(hyper_data)

# Handle deletion-resilient pagination
del_pagination_data = server.get_hyper_index(index=10, page_size=10)
print(del_pagination_data)
```

### Testing
The project includes test cases to ensure the correctness of the pagination methods. To run the tests, execute the following command:

```
python3 -m doctest -v *.py
```

### Conclusion
The Pagination Project provides a hands-on experience in implementing pagination techniques using Python. By completing the tasks, you will gain a deeper understanding of pagination concepts and their practical implementation.

## i18n Curriculum - 0x02

### Overview
The i18n Curriculum (0x02) focuses on internationalization (i18n) in a Flask web application. The goal is to create a basic Flask app, set up Babel for localization, and implement features such as parametrizing templates, forcing locale with URL parameters, emulating user login, and handling time zones.

### Project Structure
The project is organized into multiple tasks, each building upon the previous one. The tasks are outlined below:

1. **Basic Flask App**
   - Create a simple Flask app with a single route and template.
2. **Basic Babel Setup**
   - Install Flask-Babel extension and configure it with language support.
3. **Get Locale from Request**
   - Implement a function to determine the best match for the user's preferred language.
4. **Parametrize Templates**
   - Use the `_` or `gettext` function to parametrize templates and set up translation dictionaries.
5. **Force Locale with URL Parameter**
   - Implement a way to force a specific locale by passing a parameter in the app's URLs.
6. **Mock Logging In**
   - Emulate user login behavior by creating a mock user table and displaying personalized messages.
7. **Use User Locale**
   - Update the app to use a user's preferred locale, giving priority to URL parameters, user settings, and request headers.
8. **Infer Appropriate Time Zone**
   - Implement a function to infer the appropriate time zone based on URL parameters, user settings, or default to UTC.

### Requirements
